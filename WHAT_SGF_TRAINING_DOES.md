# What Does train_from_sgf.py Actually Do?

## 📖 Overview

The script teaches your neural network to **imitate professional Go players** by learning from their game records.

---

## 🔄 The Complete Process (Step-by-Step)

### STEP 1: Load SGF Files

```
Input: /Users/williamcha/Downloads/*.sgf
       (4,835 games from Shusaku, Go Seigen, Cho Chikun, etc.)
       
Process:
  → Find all .sgf files recursively
  → Read each file (text format)
  → Filter by board size (19x19 in your case)
  
Example SGF content:
  (;GM[1]PB[Shusaku]PW[Opponent]RE[B+3.5]
  ;B[qd];W[oc];B[ed];W[cd]...
```

---

### STEP 2: Parse Each Game

For each SGF file, extract:

```
Game: Shusaku vs Opponent (Black wins by 3.5)

Move 1: Black plays at Q16 (qd)
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │ · · · · · · · · │  Board state: Empty board
  │ · · · · · · · · │  Pro's move: Q16
  │ · · · · · · · · │  Game result: Black won (+1.0 for Black)
  │ · · · ● · · · · │  
  └─────────────────┘
  
Move 2: White plays at P17 (oc)
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │ · · · · · · · · │  Board state: Black stone at Q16
  │ · · · · ○ · · · │  Pro's move: P17
  │ · · · · · · · · │  Game result: Black won (-1.0 for White)
  │ · · · ● · · · · │  
  └─────────────────┘

... continue for all moves in the game ...

Result: ~100-200 training samples per game
```

**What gets extracted:**

```python
For each move:
  features = board.to_features()  # Current board state (4 feature planes)
  action = move_index             # Where the pro played (0-361 for 19x19)
  outcome = +1 or -1              # Who won from current player's view
```

---

### STEP 3: Create Training Dataset

After parsing all 4,835 games:

```
Total positions extracted: ~300,000+

Each sample is a tuple:
  (features, action, outcome)
  
Example sample:
  features = [1436 numbers]     ← Board state (4 × 19 × 19)
  action = 182                  ← Pro played at position 182
  outcome = +1.0                ← This player won
```

**The 4 feature planes** (what the network sees):

```
Plane 1: Current player's stones  (1 where stones are, 0 elsewhere)
Plane 2: Opponent's stones        (1 where stones are, 0 elsewhere)
Plane 3: Empty intersections      (1 where empty, 0 elsewhere)
Plane 4: Turn indicator          (all 1s or 0s)

Example for 19x19:
  Plane 1: [361 numbers] showing where Black stones are
  Plane 2: [361 numbers] showing where White stones are
  Plane 3: [361 numbers] showing empty spaces
  Plane 4: [361 numbers] indicating whose turn
  
Total: 1436 input numbers
```

---

### STEP 4: Split Train/Validation

```
All 300,000 positions
      ↓
Shuffle randomly
      ↓
Split 90/10:
  - Training set: 270,000 positions
  - Validation set: 30,000 positions
```

---

### STEP 5: Training Loop (15 Epochs)

**One Epoch = One pass through all training data**

```
Epoch 1:
  ↓
Shuffle training data
  ↓
Split into mini-batches (128 positions per batch)
  ↓
For each batch:
  1. Forward pass
  2. Compute loss
  3. Backward pass (gradients)
  4. Update weights
  ↓
After all batches → Validate
  ↓
Repeat for Epoch 2, 3, ... 15
```

---

### STEP 6: One Mini-Batch Training Step (DETAILED)

Let's trace through **one batch of 128 positions**:

#### A. Forward Pass

```
Input: 128 board positions (batch_size=128)
       Each position: [1436 numbers]

         Position 1        Position 2        ... Position 128
            ↓                 ↓                      ↓
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
     │     Neural Network (MLPPolicyValue)             │
     │                                                  │
     │   Input layer (1436) → Hidden (256) → Outputs   │
     │                                  ↓       ↓       │
     │                              Policy   Value      │
     │                              (362)     (1)       │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓                 ↓                      ↓
       Predictions      Predictions            Predictions
```

**Output for Position 1:**
```
Policy (move probabilities):
  [0.001, 0.002, ..., 0.05, ..., 0.001]  ← 362 numbers
                      ↑
                   Position 182 = 5% probability
                   (But pro played here!)

Value (position evaluation):
  0.3  ← Network thinks current player is ahead
```

#### B. Compute Loss

**For Position 1:**

```
Target Policy (what pro actually did):
  [0, 0, 0, ..., 1.0, ..., 0, 0]  ← One-hot: 1.0 at position 182
                  ↑
              Pro played here

Network Policy:
  [0.001, ..., 0.05, ..., 0.001]  ← Only 5% probability at 182!
              ↑

Policy Loss (Cross-Entropy):
  CE = -log(0.05) = 2.996  ← HIGH LOSS (bad!)
  
  
Target Value (game outcome):
  +1.0  ← This player won

Network Value:
  0.3  ← Network thinks they're only slightly ahead
  
Value Loss (MSE):
  MSE = (0.3 - 1.0)² = 0.49  ← ERROR!


Total Loss:
  loss = 2.996 + 1.0 × 0.49 + 0.0001 × (regularization)
       = 3.486 + small_reg
       ≈ 3.5
```

**Average over all 128 positions in batch:**
```
Batch Loss = average(all 128 position losses) = ~3.2
```

#### C. Backward Pass (Compute Gradients)

```
loss.backward()  ← PyTorch magic!

Computes:
  ∂loss/∂policy_head_weights  ← "How to change policy head to reduce loss"
  ∂loss/∂value_head_weights   ← "How to change value head to reduce loss"
  ∂loss/∂hidden_weights        ← "How to change hidden layer to reduce loss"
```

**Example gradients for Position 1:**

```
Policy head gradient at position 182:
  ∂CE/∂logit[182] = (0.05 - 1.0) / 128 = -0.0074
  → This says: "Increase the score for position 182!"

Value head gradient:
  ∂MSE/∂value = 2(0.3 - 1.0) / 128 = -0.0109
  → This says: "Increase the value prediction!"
```

#### D. Update Weights (Gradient Descent)

```
Learning rate: lr = 0.001

For each weight in the network:
  new_weight = old_weight - lr × gradient

Example for one weight in policy head:
  old_weight = 0.523
  gradient = -0.0074
  new_weight = 0.523 - 0.001 × (-0.0074)
             = 0.523 + 0.0000074
             = 0.5230074
```

After updating ALL weights, the network is slightly better!

#### E. Check Improvement

```
Forward pass again (same Position 1):

NEW Policy:
  [0.001, ..., 0.052, ..., 0.001]  ← 5.2% now (was 5%)!
              ↑
          Improved!

NEW Value:
  0.302  ← Slightly higher (was 0.3)!

NEW Loss:
  CE = -log(0.052) = 2.956 (was 2.996)  ✓
  MSE = (0.302 - 1.0)² = 0.487 (was 0.49)  ✓
  Total = 3.443 (was 3.5)  ✓ BETTER!
```

---

### STEP 7: After One Full Epoch

```
Processed all 270,000 training positions (in batches of 128)

Training Loss: 2.134  (started at ~3.5)
Validation Loss: 2.345

Validation Accuracy: 35.2%
  → Network correctly predicts pro move 35.2% of the time
```

---

### STEP 8: Repeat for 15 Epochs

```
Epoch 1:  Loss=2.134, Val Acc=35.2%
Epoch 2:  Loss=1.891, Val Acc=39.7%
Epoch 3:  Loss=1.723, Val Acc=42.8%
Epoch 5:  Loss=1.523, Val Acc=47.1%
Epoch 10: Loss=1.289, Val Acc=53.6%
Epoch 15: Loss=1.156, Val Acc=57.3%  ← Final!
```

**57.3% accuracy** = Network matches pro moves more than half the time!

---

### STEP 9: Save Weights

```
Final network weights saved to:
  /Users/williamcha/Desktop/gomcts/weights.pt

File size: ~1-2 MB

Contains:
  - fc1.weight: [256 × 1436] = hidden layer weights
  - fc1.bias: [256] = hidden layer biases
  - policy_head.weight: [362 × 256] = policy head weights
  - policy_head.bias: [362] = policy head biases
  - value_head.weight: [1 × 256] = value head weights
  - value_head.bias: [1] = value head bias
```

---

## 📊 What the Network Learns

### Policy Head Learns:
```
"In this position, what moves do pros play?"

Example learned patterns:
  - Empty corner → Play at 3-4 point or star point
  - Opponent approaches my corner → Respond with joseki
  - Fighting position → Look for cutting points
  - End game → Play big endgame moves
```

### Value Head Learns:
```
"Who is winning in this position?"

Example learned patterns:
  - More territory → Positive value
  - Weak groups → Negative value
  - Strong influence → Moderate positive value
  - Dead groups → Very negative value
```

## 🎯 Concrete Example: Before vs After Training

### Position: Opening Move

**Before Training (Random weights):**
```
Board: Empty

Network policy output:
  All moves have ~equal probability (~0.28% each)
  Move at Q16: 0.3%
  Move at center: 0.3%
  Move at edge: 0.3%
  
Value: 0.01 (basically random)
```

**After Training (57% accuracy):**
```
Board: Empty

Network policy output:
  Top moves:
    Q16 (3-4 point): 12%   ← Learned this is good!
    D4 (3-4 point): 11%
    Q4 (3-4 point): 10%
    D16 (3-4 point): 10%
    K10 (center): 3%
    A1 (corner): 0.001%  ← Learned this is bad!
    
Value: 0.05 (roughly even, as expected for empty board)
```

The network learned corner moves are best for opening!
